### Compliance Findings (GAMP5 & CSA Standards)

**Issue**: The document does not explicitly mention the need for a Quality Risk Management (QRM) process as part of the validation approach, which is a key principle in GAMP5.  
**Section**: Validation Approach, Overall Approach  
**Regulatory Reference**: GAMP5, Chapter 3 - Quality Risk Management  
**Correction**: Include a section that outlines the QRM process to be followed during the validation of the CMMS, ensuring that risks to patient safety, product quality, and data integrity are systematically assessed and managed.

**Section**: Roles  
**Regulatory Reference**: GAMP5, Section 5.1 - Roles and Responsibilities  
**Correction**: Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each team member involved in the validation process, including their specific tasks and authority levels.

**Issue**: The document does not specify the criteria for determining the risk level of changes, which is necessary for compliance with GAMP5 and CSA standards.  
**Section**: Risks and Assumptions  
**Regulatory Reference**: GAMP5, Section 3.2 - Risk Assessment  
**Correction**: Include a detailed description of how risk levels are determined for each change, referencing the Risk Levels document to ensure consistency and compliance.

**Issue**: The "Testing Overview" section lacks a detailed description of the testing types and their order, which is required by the Test Plan Template.  
**Location**: Testing Overview  
**Correction**: Provide a detailed outline of the testing types (IQ, OQ, UAT) and their sequence, as specified in the Test Plan Template.

---

**Issue**: The "Out of Scope" section is marked as "n/a," which does not align with the Test Plan Template requirements.  
**Location**: Out of Scope  
**Correction**: Either provide a relevant description of what is out of scope or remove the section entirely if it is not applicable.
